# HR-Attrition-Analysis-and-Visual-Insights
## Project Background
This project was developed in collaboration with the People Analytics and HR Operations teams to support strategic efforts around employee retention. The company operates within the Information Technology & Services sector and has experienced fast-paced growth across functions like Engineering, Sales, and R&D.

The analysis focused on identifying patterns in employee attrition using internal HR datasets containing information on job roles, compensation, tenure, promotion timelines, and work-life balance ratings. The aim was to provide visibility into workforce trends and help leadership teams understand which areas required targeted attention.

As the analyst on the project, I worked closely with stakeholders to scope key questions, clean and structure the data, and design a series of dashboards and SQL-driven summaries that could inform both immediate decisions and longer-term planning.
